        the generation and display of thumbnail images for all posts created within the drag-and-drop editor. This
        approach elevated the overall user experience to unprecedented levels. Additionally, I implemented rigorous

        300 updates per second. The front-end of the application is built with JavaScript and features a 1000x1000 board
        that allows users to send and receive updates through a websocket. </td>

      <td> This project is designed to handle a large volume of data and scale as the number of users
        and data increased. By leveraging a Docker swarm, workload distribution
        was achieved across multiple containers to maximize scalability and enhance system resilience. The system was
        further optimized for performance by implementing Redis caching and streams. Redis caching reduced the need for
        repeated database queries by storing frequently accessed data in memory, improving response times by 65%. Redis
        streams
        enabled the system to process incoming data efficiently, further enhancing its ability to handle large volumes
        of data. Redis streams improved the response times up to 90% for write requests. The result was a highly
        efficient, scalable, and reliable system capable of handling high loads of
        traffic without any disruptions or downtime.</td>
