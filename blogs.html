            <p>     In 2018 I graduated from high school and started university; I chose to go to the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) and study Computer Science. Many people consider this program to be difficult, but no one told me what made it tough or how to prepare. 



After classes started, I quickly realized the concept of POST; this meant I needed to achieve certain marks and maintain a specified GPA.  I wish I knew of this before because this meant I might not be studying computer science after first year and that added a lot of stress.  If I knew this before, maybe I would have chosen another university that could guarantee me a spot in the program. I also wish I knew about distribution requirements because I did not take any humanities classes in first year and now it is more difficult since there is less space for elective courses.



It requires a lot more time and effort to succeed in post-secondary, which meant my time management skills needed to improve. Many courses require you to complete weekly tasks, assignments, readings, and tests/quizzes at the same time.  This is remarkably different from high school so it was awfully overwhelming at first. I also needed to incorporate some time for a longer commute and my part-time job; this resulted in less sleep and depending on coffee to stay awake. If I knew about these hardships beforehand, I would have invested some energy into various time planning tools or sought help from a professional. 



My advice to future students would be to research each program you are interested in and make an informed decision. Clear up any misconceptions and questions you may have that way you can avoid any surprises down the road. Be prepared to face a more demanding course load and create a plan for each day so you have adequate time to finish everything.</p>
